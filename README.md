# connect-the-dots_km-coding-challenge

Hello!

The client folder and everything in it was provided by Konica Minolta for the purposes of completing this coding challenge.
The server and everything in it was developed by me, TJVaughn.

# Details about the project

The client simply initializes and then communicates when a node is clicked. It also draws a line from the starting point to the ending point provided by the server.
This means it does not provide any logic regarding how the game is played.

This project uses WebSockets to communicate bi-directionally between the server and the client.
